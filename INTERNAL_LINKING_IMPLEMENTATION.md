## Usage Guidelines

### Adding Internal Links to New Pages

1. **Import components:**

import Breadcrumbs from '../components/Breadcrumbs';
import RelatedServices from '../components/RelatedServices';
import YouMightAlsoLike from '../components/YouMightAlsoLike';
import { InlineLink } from '../components/ContextualLinks';
```

2. **Add breadcrumbs below NavBar:**
```tsx
<Breadcrumbs
  items={[
    { label: "Services", path: "/services/category" },
    { label: "Category Name", path: "/services/category" },
    { label: "Current Page", path: "/current-page" }
  ]}
/>
```

3. **Add inline contextual links in content:**
```tsx
<p>
  Learn more about our <InlineLink to="/services/related-service">Related Service</InlineLink>.
</p>
```

4. **Add related services section before footer:**
```tsx
<RelatedServices
  title="Related Services"
  services={[
    {
      title: "Service Name",
      description: "Brief description",
      link: "/services/service-slug"
    }
  ]}
/>
```

5. **Add suggestions section:**
```tsx
<YouMightAlsoLike
  suggestions={[
    {
      title: "Page Title",
      description: "Why this page is relevant",
      link: "/page-slug"
    }
  ]}
/>
```

## Hub Pages Routes

The following hub pages are now accessible:
- `/services/accessibility` - Accessibility Services Hub
- `/services/flooring` - Flooring Services Hub
- `/services/remodeling` - Remodeling Services Hub

## Footer Updates

The footer now includes:
- Four-column layout with organized links
- Company links (Home, About, Contact, FAQ)
- Service category links (Accessibility, Remodeling, Flooring, Handyman)
- Popular services (Most requested services)
- Service areas (City-specific pages)

## Next Steps

To fully implement internal linking across the entire site:

1. **Update all service pages** with the new components (similar to wheelchair ramps example)
2. **Add contextual links** within page content where relevant
3. **Create more hub pages** for other service categories (repairs, cleanouts, etc.)
4. **Update city-specific pages** with local service links
5. **Add internal links to blog content** (if blog exists)
6. **Monitor performance** using Google Search Console and Analytics

## Maintenance

- Update `src/utils/relatedServices.ts` when adding new services
- Keep hub pages current with latest offerings
- Review and update contextual links quarterly
- Check for broken links monthly
- Monitor user engagement with internal links via analytics

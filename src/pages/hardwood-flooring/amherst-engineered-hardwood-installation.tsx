              <h2>Benefits of Engineered Hardwood for Amherst Homes</h2>
              <h2>Engineered vs Solid Hardwood: Which is Best for Amherst NY?</h2>
              <h2>How Much Does Engineered Hardwood Cost in Amherst?</h2>
              
              <p>Engineered hardwood flooring offers Amherst homeowners the beauty of real hardwood with enhanced stability and versatility. This innovative flooring solution works beautifully in basements, over radiant heat, and in areas where solid hardwood isn't recommended.</p>
              <p>Engineered hardwood consists of a real hardwood veneer (wear layer) over multiple layers of plywood or high-density fiberboard. This construction makes it more dimensionally stable than solid hardwood, meaning it resists expansion and contraction from humidity changes that affect Amherst homes year-round.</p>
              <p>Amherst homeowners choose engineered hardwood for several key advantages. It can be installed in basements where moisture levels fluctuate, works over concrete subfloors, and installs faster than solid hardwood. Many engineered products feature click-lock systems allowing floating installation without nails or glue, reducing installation time and cost.</p>
              <p>Quality engineered hardwood looks identical to solid hardwood once installed. The wear layer thickness determines longevityâ€”thicker wear layers (4-6mm) can be refinished 1-2 times, extending floor life to 30+ years. We install all major brands including Bruce, Shaw, Mohawk, and Armstrong throughout Amherst.</p>
              <p>Installation methods for engineered hardwood in Amherst include floating (over underlayment), glue-down (for concrete), and nail-down (for wood subfloors). We assess your home's specific conditions and recommend the best installation method for long-term performance. Most Amherst installations complete in 2-4 days depending on square footage.</p>

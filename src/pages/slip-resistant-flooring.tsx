          <section className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              At <strong>Aaron Michael Services</strong>, we specialize in recommending and installing flooring that maximizes safety, durability, and accessibility. Slip-resistant and low-pile flooring options reduce the risk of falls, improve mobility for seniors and individuals with disabilities, and are compliant with ADA recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Buffalo-area homes and businesses face unique challenges including snow, ice, and moisture. Selecting flooring that can withstand these conditions while remaining safe is critical. Our team provides expertise for flooring in residential and commercial properties in Buffalo, Kenmore, Tonawanda, North Tonawanda, and Cheektowaga.

          {/* Importance of Slip-Resistant Flooring */}
          <section className="space-y-4">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Why Slip-Resistant Flooring Matters</h2>
            <p>
              Slip-resistant flooring minimizes accidents, particularly in high-risk areas such as bathrooms, kitchens, entryways, and commercial spaces. According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/falls/" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">CDC</a> guidelines, falls are a leading cause of injury in seniors. Proper flooring selection significantly reduces these risks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Low-pile flooring, in addition to slip resistance, ensures that wheelchairs, walkers, and canes glide smoothly without obstruction. This is essential for accessibility and aging-in-place solutions.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* Flooring Types */}
          <section className="space-y-12">

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Common Types of Slip-Resistant Flooring</h2>

            <div className="space-y-8">

              {/* Vinyl Flooring */}
              <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Vinyl Flooring</h3>
                <p>
                  Vinyl is highly durable, water-resistant, and offers excellent slip-resistance. It comes in low-pile sheet, tile, and plank formats. Ideal for bathrooms, kitchens, and high-traffic areas, vinyl provides long-term performance with minimal maintenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Buffalo-area homes benefit from vinyl's resilience against moisture and temperature fluctuations. Aaron Michael Services installs low-pile, slip-resistant vinyl that complies with ADA and local safety codes.
                </p>
              </div>

              {/* Rubber Flooring */}
              <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Rubber Flooring</h3>
                <p>
                  Rubber flooring is naturally slip-resistant and shock-absorbing. It is commonly used in entryways, gyms, healthcare facilities, and kitchens. Low-pile rubber mats reduce trip hazards while providing cushioning to reduce fall injuries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rubber is resistant to moisture, mold, and temperature extremes common in Western New York, making it a reliable choice for both residential and commercial projects.
                </p>
              </div>

              {/* Low-Pile Carpet */}
              <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Low-Pile Carpet</h3>
                <p>
                  Low-pile carpet is less than 1/4 inch in thickness, providing ease of movement for wheelchairs and walkers while reducing slip potential. High-traffic hallways, offices, and bedrooms can benefit from low-pile carpet with slip-resistant backing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We recommend commercial-grade low-pile carpet for durability, ease of cleaning, and compliance with accessibility standards.
                </p>
              </div>

              {/* Tile Flooring */}
              <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Ceramic and Porcelain Tile</h3>
                <p>
                  Tile offers durability and water resistance but requires proper surface treatment to prevent slips. Slip-resistant tile, textured finishes, or anti-slip coatings ensure safety in kitchens, bathrooms, and entryways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For Buffalo-area climates, we recommend tiles with frost-resistant properties and low-pile, slip-resistant mats in transitional areas.
                </p>
              </div>

              {/* Engineered Hardwood */}
              <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Engineered Hardwood</h3>
                <p>
                  Engineered hardwood provides the aesthetic of traditional hardwood while offering better moisture resistance. Anti-slip finishes and low-pile rugs help maintain safety in living areas and hallways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This flooring type combines elegance with practical slip-resistance when properly installed and treated, ideal for Buffalo homes looking for beauty and safety.
                </p>
              </div>

              {/* LVT (Luxury Vinyl Tile) */}
              <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Luxury Vinyl Tile (LVT)</h3>
                <p>
                  LVT combines the durability of vinyl with realistic textures resembling wood or stone. It is naturally low-pile and can be textured or coated for enhanced slip resistance. LVT is perfect for aging-in-place renovations and high-traffic commercial areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Aaron Michael Services installs LVT that meets ADA guidelines for slip resistance while maintaining visual appeal for residential and business clients in Buffalo, Kenmore, Tonawanda, North Tonawanda, and Cheektowaga.

          {/* Installation & Maintenance */}
          <section className="space-y-4">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Installation and Maintenance Tips</h2>
            <p>
              Proper installation is key to achieving both slip-resistance and long-term durability. Aaron Michael Services ensures precise leveling, adhesive application, and treatment for all flooring types.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regular cleaning with non-slip-safe products, inspection for wear, and addressing any curling, warping, or loose tiles prolong the life of your flooring while maintaining safety. Seasonal checks are especially important in Buffalo’s climate.
            </p>
            <p>
              For homes using wheelchairs, walkers, or canes, low-pile and slip-resistant surfaces reduce fatigue, improve maneuverability, and prevent accidents.

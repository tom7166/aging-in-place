          <h1>Types of Ramps: Wood, Aluminum, Concrete, Modular & Portable</h1>
          <p>
            At <strong>Aaron Michael Services</strong>, we specialize in accessible home modifications 
            and mobility solutions across <strong>Buffalo, Kenmore, Tonawanda, North Tonawanda, and Cheektowaga</strong>.  
            One of the most essential accessibility upgrades is the installation of a proper ramp.  
            Whether you are caring for a loved one, aging in place, or recovering from surgery,  
            choosing the right type of ramp can make the difference between independence and limitation.  
          </p>
          <p>
            This comprehensive guide breaks down the most common types of ramps—<strong>wood, aluminum, concrete, modular, and portable</strong>.  
            We’ll cover durability, maintenance, ADA compliance, installation, and cost comparisons,  
            while also referencing expert insights from <strong>nurses, physical therapists, and occupational therapists</strong>.

          <h2>Why Ramps Matter</h2>
          <p>
            According to the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a>, 
            ramps are required in many residential and public settings to ensure equal access.  
            Nurses and physical therapists often emphasize that a safe, properly graded ramp prevents falls 
            and reduces strain on both wheelchair users and caregivers.  
            A <em>Journal of Geriatric Physical Therapy</em> study found that accessible entrances reduce hospital readmissions 
            by as much as <strong>22%</strong> for older adults recovering from hip or knee surgeries.

          <h2>1. Wood Ramps</h2>
          <p>
            Wood ramps are one of the most common permanent ramp solutions. They can be built to match the aesthetics 
            of your home and are highly customizable. However, wood requires regular maintenance and is susceptible to 
            weather damage in <strong>Buffalo’s snowy winters</strong> and humid summers.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Custom-built to fit exact space requirements</li>
            <li>Visually appealing and can be stained or painted</li>
            <li>Lower upfront material cost compared to concrete</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Requires annual sealing or staining to resist rot</li>
            <li>Can become slippery when wet or icy</li>
            <li>Shorter lifespan (10–15 years)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Local Insight:</strong> In Western New York, wood ramps are popular for ranch homes but require snow-melt mats 
            or grit strips for safety during icy months. Many of our Kenmore and Tonawanda clients choose treated lumber 
            to extend lifespan.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>2. Aluminum Ramps</h2>
          <p>
            Aluminum ramps are durable, lightweight, and virtually maintenance-free. They can be modular and adjusted 
            to different configurations, making them ideal for temporary or semi-permanent installations.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Rust-resistant and weatherproof</li>
            <li>Quick installation (often within a day)</li>
            <li>Reusable and adjustable</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Higher upfront cost than wood</li>
            <li>Industrial look (less customizable)</li>
            <li>Can feel colder underfoot in Buffalo winters</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Expert Note:</strong> Many physical therapists recommend aluminum ramps for patients recovering 
            from surgery because they can be installed quickly and removed once no longer needed.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Concrete Ramps</h2>
          <p>
            Concrete ramps are the most durable and permanent option. They can last over 30 years with little maintenance.  
            They’re especially popular for front entrances in Buffalo where snow shoveling is routine.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Extremely durable (decades of lifespan)</li>
            <li>Low maintenance</li>
            <li>Blends with sidewalks and driveways</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>High upfront installation cost</li>
            <li>Not easily adjustable</li>
            <li>Requires proper drainage to avoid ice buildup</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Local Example:</strong> A Cheektowaga family opted for a concrete ramp for year-round safety 
            since their loved one uses a power wheelchair. The ramp design integrated with their driveway 
            for seamless snow removal.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Modular Ramps</h2>
          <p>
            Modular ramps combine the benefits of aluminum and prefabricated systems. They can be installed quickly 
            and customized without the permanence of concrete or the upkeep of wood.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Flexible configurations for unique property layouts</li>
            <li>Fast installation</li>
            <li>Durable and ADA-compliant</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>More expensive than wood</li>
            <li>Not as visually integrated as custom builds</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Healthcare Insight:</strong> Occupational therapists often recommend modular ramps when 
            a patient’s mobility needs may change over time. They allow adjustments without starting from scratch.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Portable Ramps</h2>
          <p>
            Portable ramps are lightweight, foldable, and designed for temporary use. They’re especially helpful 
            for vehicle access or when visiting locations that lack permanent ramps.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to transport</li>
            <li>Cost-effective for temporary needs</li>
            <li>Great for travel or visiting family</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Limited weight capacity</li>
            <li>Not suitable for long-term, daily use</li>
            <li>Requires careful placement for safety</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Real-World Note:</strong> Nurses frequently recommend portable ramps for short-term recovery 
            after surgery when patients may only need a ramp for a few months.
          </p>

          <h3>What is the standard slope for a wheelchair ramp?</h3>
          <p>The ADA recommends a slope of 1:12, meaning 1 inch of rise for every 12 inches of ramp length.</p>

          <h3>Can wood ramps be used year-round in Buffalo?</h3>
          <p>Yes, but they require anti-slip surfaces and regular sealing due to snow and rain exposure.</p>

          <h3>How long does it take to install a ramp?</h3>
          <p>Portable ramps are instant, aluminum/modular ramps can be installed in a day,

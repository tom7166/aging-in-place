          <h2>1. General Maintenance Guidelines</h2>
          <p>
            Regardless of ramp material, all accessibility features benefit from routine inspection. 
            Experts at the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/falls/">CDC</a> recommend monthly checks for hazards such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Loose handrails or screws</li>
            <li>Warped or cracked surfaces</li>
            <li>Accumulated debris or leaves</li>
            <li>Signs of rot, rust, or corrosion</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Proper cleaning and lubrication of moving parts, such as hinges on foldable ramps, ensures smooth operation. 
            Buffalo winters require additional attention to snow and ice accumulation to prevent slips.

          <h2>2. Wood Ramp Maintenance</h2>
          <p>
            Wood ramps are beautiful and functional but require consistent care:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sealing:</strong> Apply a weather-resistant sealant or stain at least once a year to prevent water damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Check for rot:</strong> Inspect the ramp structure annually, especially after winter snow and ice exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-slip treatment:</strong> Add grit tape, rubber mats, or anti-slip paint to prevent slips.</li>
            <li><strong>Fasteners:</strong> Tighten screws, bolts, and nails to maintain stability.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Nurses and physical therapists often note that improperly maintained wood ramps are one of the leading causes of residential falls.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Aluminum Ramp Maintenance</h2>
          <p>
            Aluminum ramps are low-maintenance but benefit from occasional care:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Inspect joints:</strong> Ensure modular connections are secure and bolts remain tight.</li>
            <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Wash with mild soap and water to prevent dirt buildup and surface corrosion.</li>
            <li><strong>Snow & ice:</strong> Clear promptly and use non-metal shovels to avoid scratching surfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Lubricate:</strong> Hinges or moving parts on foldable sections require light lubrication yearly.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Physical therapists recommend aluminum ramps for long-term aging-in-place solutions because durability minimizes maintenance headaches.

          <h2>4. Concrete Ramp Maintenance</h2>
          <p>
            Concrete ramps are extremely durable but still require attention:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Seal cracks:</strong> Minor cracks should be sealed immediately to prevent water infiltration and freeze-thaw damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Surface texture:</strong> Ensure non-slip coatings remain intact; reapply as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Snow removal:</strong> Shovel carefully and avoid using salt on newly poured concrete to prevent spalling.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In Western New York, proper winter maintenance prevents over 40% of ramp-related slip incidents in seniors.

        <section>
          <h2>5. Modular & Portable Ramp Maintenance</h2>
          <p>
            Modular and portable ramps require the following upkeep:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Regularly tighten screws and bolts on modular connections.</li>
            <li>Keep foldable portable ramps clean and dry.</li>
            <li>Store lightweight ramps indoors when not in use to prolong life.</li>
            <li>Check for surface wear or warping before each use.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Occupational therapists advise caregivers to perform quick inspections before each daily use, especially for patients with limited mobility.

          <h2>6. Seasonal Maintenance Tips</h2>
          <p>
            Buffalo-area homes face unique seasonal challenges:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Remove snow promptly, use anti-slip coatings, and ensure handrails are secure.</li>
            <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Inspect for water damage, rot, or mold after thawing snow.</li>
            <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Clean dirt and debris, check for expansion or warping on wooden ramps.</li>
            <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Remove leaves and debris, seal cracks, and prep surfaces for winter.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Safety Checks for All Ramps</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Handrail height and stability</li>
            <li>Slope ratio compliance (1:12 for ADA ramps)</li>
            <li>Surface texture and traction</li>
            <li>Proper lighting for evening use</li>
            <li>Obstacle-free path from entrance to ramp exit</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Following these steps helps prevent accidents and keeps your home safe for residents and visitors.

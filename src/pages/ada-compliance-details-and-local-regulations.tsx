            At <strong>Aaron Michael Services</strong>, accessibility is at the heart of what we do.
            Our team specializes in ensuring that every ramp, entryway, and modification we build
            complies fully with the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a>
            and meets all local building codes in <strong>Buffalo, Kenmore, Tonawanda, North Tonawanda, and Cheektowaga</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding ADA compliance can feel overwhelming. This page provides a detailed breakdown of
            the requirements, practical implications, and how Western New York’s weather and local ordinances
            shape accessibility solutions for homes and businesses.

          <h2>What is ADA Compliance?</h2>
          <p>
            The Americans with Disabilities Act, signed into law in 1990, protects the rights of individuals
            with disabilities by ensuring equal access to buildings, services, and public spaces.
            Compliance means that features such as ramps, handrails, entrances, and pathways are
            designed and built to meet specific safety and usability standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the <em>ADA National Network</em>, nearly 1 in 4 adults in the U.S. lives with a disability,
            which underscores the importance of creating inclusive environments. In Buffalo alone,
            census data indicates that more than <strong>14%</strong> of residents report mobility-related limitations.

          <h2>Key ADA Ramp Requirements</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Slope:</strong> A 1:12 slope ratio (1 inch of rise for every 12 inches of ramp length).</li>
            <li><strong>Width:</strong> At least 36 inches of clear width between handrails.</li>
            <li><strong>Landings:</strong> Level landings at top and bottom, and at intervals for longer ramps.</li>
            <li><strong>Handrails:</strong> Required for ramps with a rise greater than 6 inches.</li>
            <li><strong>Surface:</strong> Must be firm, stable, and slip-resistant.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Physical therapists often emphasize slope and surface as the most critical factors
            in preventing falls and ensuring safe transfers for wheelchair users and those using walkers.

          <h2>Local Regulations in Buffalo & WNY</h2>
          <p>
            While the ADA sets federal standards, municipalities in Western New York, including
            Buffalo, Cheektowaga, and Tonawanda, enforce building codes that must also be met.
            These codes may cover issues such as snow removal, drainage, and structural integrity.
          </p>
          <h3>Examples of Local Ordinances:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Buffalo:</strong> Requires permits for ramps attached to residential or commercial structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheektowaga:</strong> Enforces zoning requirements to ensure ramps do not block sidewalks or public access.</li>
            <li><strong>Tonawanda:</strong> May require inspections for ramps exceeding certain dimensions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Local Insight:</strong> Our team regularly coordinates with local inspectors to ensure every installation
            passes smoothly. In snowy regions like Buffalo, additional attention is paid to slope and drainage to minimize ice hazards.

          <h2>ADA and Residential Homes</h2>
          <p>
            While ADA compliance is often associated with businesses and public spaces, residential homeowners
            also benefit from following the guidelines. Nurses and occupational therapists note that patients
            discharged from hospitals after surgery or injury are safer returning to homes equipped with
            ADA-compliant ramps and entrances.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Case Example:</strong> In Kenmore, we installed a modular aluminum ramp for a client recovering
            from hip replacement surgery. The ADA slope ratio allowed her to safely transition from her home
            to physical therapy appointments without assistance.
          </p>

          <h2>Snow, Ice, and ADA Considerations in Buffalo</h2>
          <p>
            Western New York’s harsh winters make accessibility even more challenging. ADA guidelines require
            surfaces to be slip-resistant, but local conditions demand extra features like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Heated mats or snow-melt systems for ramps</li>
            <li>Textured aluminum surfaces</li>
            <li>Non-slip coatings on wood and concrete</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A study in the <em>Journal of Environmental Health</em> found that slip-resistant surfaces reduce
            winter-related falls by nearly <strong>40%</strong> in older populations.

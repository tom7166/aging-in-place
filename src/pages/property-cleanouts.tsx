                Initial Assessment & Planning
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-13 mb-4">
                Every successful property cleanout begins with careful planning. When you contact Aaron Michael Services for cleanout services in <strong>Buffalo, Amherst, Tonawanda, Kenmore</strong>, or anywhere throughout Western New York, we schedule an on-site assessment to evaluate the full scope of work required.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-13 mb-4">
                During this initial walkthrough, our team examines every area of the property from attic to basement, including garages, sheds, and outdoor spaces. We document the volume and type of items to be removed, identify any items requiring special handling (hazardous materials, valuable items, sensitive documents), assess access considerations like narrow doorways or stairs, and evaluate disposal requirements for different material categories.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-13">
                This thorough assessment allows us to provide an accurate, detailed quote with no hidden surprises. We discuss your timeline, any specific concerns or priorities, and whether you need us to watch for particular items during the cleanout process. For estate cleanouts, we work sensitively with family members to understand which items should be set aside for review. For rental or foreclosure properties, we coordinate with property managers or real estate agents to ensure proper documentation.
              </p>

                Systematic Room-by-Room Clearing
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-13 mb-4">
                On cleanout day, our experienced crew arrives with all necessary equipment, including dollies, hand trucks, protective materials, and appropriate vehicles for efficient hauling. We work systematically through the property, typically starting from upper floors and working downward to avoid moving items multiple times.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-13 mb-4">
                Our team carefully removes all contents from each room, including furniture, appliances, personal items, decorations, and accumulated belongings. We take special care with appliances that require disconnectionâ€”refrigerators are properly defrosted, gas appliances are safely disconnected, and water lines are shut off and capped as needed. Throughout the process, we protect the property with floor runners, door jamb protection, and corner guards to prevent damage to walls, floors, and doorways.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-13">
                For properties with outdoor areas, we clear yards, patios, decks, sheds, and garages of debris, overgrown vegetation, old equipment, and stored items. Western New York weather can lead to accumulated yard waste and outdoor deterioration, so we address these areas comprehensively to improve property appearance and value.

                Sorting, Donation & Responsible Disposal
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-13 mb-4">
                Environmental responsibility is central to our cleanout process. Rather than simply hauling everything to a landfill, we carefully sort materials into appropriate categories for donation, recycling, and disposal. This approach not only benefits the environment but often recovers value from items that others can use.

                Final Sweep & Property Handoff
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-13 mb-4">
                After all items are removed, our team performs a final walkthrough of the entire property to ensure nothing has been overlooked. We sweep and remove any remaining debris, leaving the property completely clear and ready for its next phaseâ€”whether that's renovation, listing for sale, new tenant move-in, or demolition.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-13 mb-4">
                For properties being prepared for listing, this clean slate makes it easier for real estate photographers, staging professionals, or renovation contractors to begin their work immediately. For rental properties, the cleared space allows property managers to assess needed repairs and prepare for turnover work. For estate settlements, the completed cleanout provides families with closure and allows them to move forward with property disposition.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-13">
                We provide before and after photos documenting the transformation, along with detailed receipts showing what was donated, recycled, and disposed of. This documentation is particularly valuable for estate executors, insurance claims, or tax purposes. Our goal is to deliver a completely cleared property with full transparency about how materials were handled.

                  How much does a property cleanout cost in Buffalo NY?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Property cleanout costs vary based on property size, volume of items, access difficulty, and disposal requirements. A typical single-family home cleanout in Buffalo, Amherst, or Tonawanda ranges from $1,500 to $5,000. Small apartments or condos might cost $800-$2,000, while larger estates or properties with extensive accumulation can exceed $7,000. Commercial cleanouts are priced based on square footage and material volume. We provide free on-site estimates with detailed, itemized pricing so you understand all costs before work begins. Factors affecting price include amount of furniture and appliances, presence of hazardous materials, accessibility challenges like stairs or narrow doors, disposal and recycling fees, and timeline urgency. We work within your budget and can often phase work to spread costs if needed.

                  How quickly can you complete a property cleanout?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Most residential property cleanouts in Western New York are completed in 1-3 days depending on size and volume. Small apartments or condos often take just 4-8 hours. Average single-family homes typically require 1-2 full days. Large estates or properties with extensive accumulation may need 3-5 days. We can often begin work within 24-48 hours of your call for urgent situations like rental turnovers, estate settlements with closing deadlines, or foreclosure clearing. For same-day service requests, call us early in the morning and we'll do everything possible to accommodate your timeline. We understand that vacant properties cost money, so we work efficiently without sacrificing thoroughness or quality.

                  What items can you remove during a property cleanout?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  We remove virtually everything from properties: furniture, appliances, electronics, clothing, personal belongings, yard debris, construction materials, and general household items. We handle refrigerators, freezers, washers, dryers, stoves, dishwashers, and water heaters with proper disconnection. Large items like pianos, hot tubs, pool tables, and exercise equipment are removed carefully. We also clear basements, attics, garages, sheds, and outdoor spaces. Items we cannot remove include hazardous chemicals in large quantities (though we handle typical household amounts), asbestos materials, underground fuel tanks, and items requiring specialized environmental remediation. For these specialized items, we can recommend qualified contractors. Everything else is fair game for our cleanout services.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Environmental responsibility is a cornerstone of our service. We make every effort to divert items from landfills through donation and recycling. Usable furniture, appliances, clothing, and household goods are donated to Buffalo-area charities including Goodwill, Habitat for Humanity ReStore, Vietnam Veterans of America, and local churches and community organizations. Metals, electronics, cardboard, and other recyclables go to appropriate recycling facilities. We provide donation receipts for tax purposes when requested. Only items that are truly unusableâ€”damaged beyond repair, unsanitary, or prohibited by donation centersâ€”are sent to disposal facilities. This approach benefits the community, reduces environmental impact, and often lowers your costs since disposal fees are minimized.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Yes, we can absolutely watch for specific items during the cleanout process. This service is especially important for estate cleanouts where family heirlooms, jewelry, collectibles, or important documents might be hidden among general belongings. Before we begin, we discuss what you'd like us to watch forâ€”valuables, family photos, legal documents, financial records, or specific personal items. Our team examines drawers, checks pockets, looks through boxes, and carefully sorts rather than simply discarding. Items of potential value or importance are set aside for your review. While we cannot guarantee finding every small item in a house full of belongings, our careful, methodical approach dramatically increases the chances of recovering important items before they're lost forever. For estate cleanouts, this service provides tremendous peace of mind to families.

                  You don't need to be present throughout the entire cleanout, though many clients prefer to be there at the start to point out any special instructions or areas of concern. After initial walkthroughs, most property owners, investors, or executors leave us to work independently. We're fully insured and trustworthyâ€”we've built our Buffalo reputation on reliability and professionalism. For estate cleanouts where items need to be reviewed, we can set aside potential valuables for your inspection at convenient times. We provide progress photos and communicate regularly throughout multi-day projects. At completion, we do a final walkthrough with you (or your representative) to ensure you're completely satisfied before we leave. Flexible scheduling and communication ensure the process works around your availability while still moving forward efficiently.

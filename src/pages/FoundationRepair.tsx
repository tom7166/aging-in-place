              <strong>We specialize exclusively in pier & beam foundation repair.</strong> While most contractors in Western New York won't touch pier & beam foundations,
              we've spent over 22 years mastering this dying trade. If you own a historic Buffalo-area home built on pier & beam construction and you're dealing with
              sagging floors, bouncy spots, settling, or crawlspace issues â€” we're the contractors to call.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Pier & beam foundations require specialized expertise.</strong> You can't fix them the same way you'd repair poured concrete or block foundations.
              They demand precise jacking and leveling techniques, expert joist sistering, proper pier replacement, crawlspace moisture management, and careful shimming
              to restore structural integrity without causing damage. Most contractors simply don't have this knowledge anymore.
            </p>

            <p>
              Aaron Michael Services is one of the last few contractors in Western New York with genuine pier & beam foundation repair expertise. We work on historic
              Buffalo bungalows, Kenmore craftsman homes, North Tonawanda cottages, and Amherst properties built in the early-to-mid 1900s. We understand the original
              construction methods, source the right materials, and execute repairs that last for decades.

              <p>
                <strong>Pier & beam foundations are a dying specialty.</strong> Most contractors today only work with poured concrete or
                block foundations. But many historic Buffalo-area homes â€” especially bungalows, craftsman-style houses, and older structures
                built before the 1950s â€” sit on pier & beam systems. These foundations require specialized knowledge of:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Proper jacking techniques</strong> to level floors without damaging joists or load-bearing beams</li>
                <li><strong>Crawlspace moisture management</strong> that prevents rot and pest damage</li>
                <li><strong>Shimming and pier replacement</strong> using materials that match the original construction methods</li>
                <li><strong>Joist sistering and reinforcement</strong> when original lumber has weakened or sagged</li>
                <li><strong>Ventilation improvements</strong> that reduce humidity while maintaining structural support</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                We've spent over two decades mastering these techniques. When other contractors say "we don't do that type of foundation,"
                we show up with the tools, materials, and experience to fix it right. If you have a pier & beam foundation showing signs
                of settling, bouncy floors, or crawlspace issues â€” call us. We're one of the last few who can help.

            <p>
              Western New York presents unique challenges for pier & beam foundations. Freeze-thaw cycles, high water tables, and clay-heavy soils
              create movement and moisture problems that accelerate pier settling and wood rot. A contractor who understands how Buffalo-area
              foundations behave â€” and who knows the original construction methods used in 1920s-1950s homes â€” delivers repairs that last.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most contractors simply don't work on pier & beam foundations anymore. They'll turn down the job or attempt repairs using incorrect
              techniques meant for concrete foundations. At Aaron Michael Services, we've been repairing pier & beam foundations for over 22 years.
              We know the right way to jack floors, replace piers, sister joists, and manage crawlspace moisture for historic Western New York homes.

                <p>
                  We enter the crawlspace and inspect every pier, joist, beam, and support structure. We look for settling piers, rotted wood,
                  moisture damage, improper shimming, and structural weakness. We use moisture meters and levels to quantify problems and document
                  everything with photos.

                  essential for insurance claims, real estate transactions, or simply having a record of professional repairs for future homeowners.

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">How do I know if I have a pier & beam foundation?</h3>
                <p>
                  If your home was built before the 1960s and has a crawlspace underneath (not a full basement or slab), you likely have a pier & beam foundation.
                  These homes typically have wooden floors that feel slightly bouncy, and you can access the crawlspace to see the wooden joists, beams, and
                  concrete or masonry piers supporting the structure.
                </p>

              <div>
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">What are signs my pier & beam foundation needs repair?</h3>
                <p>
                  Common signs include sagging or sloping floors, bouncy spots when walking, doors and windows that stick or won't close properly, visible gaps

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">Why can't most contractors fix pier & beam foundations?</h3>
                <p>
                  Pier & beam repair requires specialized knowledge that most modern contractors don't have. It involves understanding load distribution,
                  proper jacking techniques to avoid damaging joists, selecting the right lumber for sistering, and knowing how to match historic construction methods.
                  Most contractors today only work with concrete foundations, so they decline pier & beam jobs or attempt repairs using incorrect techniques.

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">How long do pier & beam foundation repairs take?</h3>
                <p>
                  Repair timelines depend on the scope of work. Simple pier replacements or limited joist sistering can take 1-3 days. More extensive repairs
                  involving multiple piers, significant leveling, and crawlspace moisture remediation may take 5-7 days. We provide a clear timeline in your estimate.

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">Will repairing my pier & beam foundation increase home value?</h3>
                <p>
                  Absolutely. Properly documented pier & beam foundation repairs increase buyer confidence and marketability. Many buyers and real estate
                  agents are concerned about pier & beam foundations, so having professional documentation of recent repairs is a major selling point.

            <p>
              A 1940s Kenmore bungalow built on pier & beam showed significant floor sagging in the living room and bouncy spots near interior walls.
              Several contractors declined the job, citing lack of experience with pier & beam systems. After our inspection, we identified three
              failing piers, rotted rim joists, and inadequate crawlspace ventilation.
            </p>
            <p>
              We replaced the compromised piers with properly-sized concrete supports, sistered the damaged joists with treated lumber, and
              re-leveled the floor using hydraulic jacks and precision shimming. We also installed crawlspace vents and a vapor barrier to
              prevent future moisture damage. The homeowner now has a solid, level floor â€” and documentation for future resale.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the kind of specialized work most contractors can't or won't do. But for homes built on pier & beam, it's the only
              way to restore structural integrity and protect property value.

          <p>
            <strong>If you own a historic Buffalo-area home built on pier & beam construction, you need a contractor who actually knows how to repair it.</strong>
            Most contractors will turn you down. Some will attempt repairs using techniques meant for concrete foundations â€” which can cause more damage
            than they fix. At Aaron Michael Services, pier & beam foundation repair is what we do. It's our specialty. We've been doing it for over 22 years.
          </p>

          <p>
            We understand the structural challenges of Western New York's freeze-thaw cycles, clay soils, and high water tables. We know how to properly
            jack floors without cracking plaster or damaging joists. We know which lumber to use for sistering. We know how to replace piers using methods
            that match the original construction. And we know how to manage crawlspace moisture to prevent future rot.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>This is specialized work, and there aren't many contractors left who can do it.</strong> If you're one of the homeowners dealing with
            sagging floors, settling piers, or crawlspace issues â€” and you've been turned away by other contractors â€” call us. We'll inspect your pier & beam
            foundation, provide a detailed written report, and give you a clear repair plan and cost estimate.
          </p>
